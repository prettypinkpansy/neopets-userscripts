Hi! I'm Red (prettypinkpansy) and these are my Neopets userscripts. Currently there is just the one: Battledome But With A Cool Sports Car.

# Battledome But With A Cool Sports Car

You will need a browser addon such as <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/">Tampermonkey</a> to install this.

This is a **purely cosmetic script that will not interfere with anything**. It will work on both normal Battledome pages and The Void Within battles. It's simple: it will **put any pet you're battling with in a car**, because that's really funny.

The car itself is a <a href="https://items.jellyneo.net/search/?name=usuki+dream+car">Usuki Dream Car</a>, a real item you can get and equip to your pet, but you don't need to have it equipped for the script to work. I made this script because the layer it's on does not show in the Battledome. My battledome pet loves his car, so I wanted him to be able to use it to run over the Giant Space Fungus as Fyora intended.

You can **change the color of the car to match your pet** by changing the indicated portion at the start of the script to pink, red, black, or blue, corresponding to the Dyeworks variations of this item.

Some shorter Battledome pets, e.g. babies or Jubjubs, may have trouble reaching the controls. Some extremely large pets (e.g. Mutant Chomby) may bulge out of the car itself. Sorry about that. I don't think there's a way to detect species/color and adjust the height manually. Maybe in a future version I'll try to fix this by adding a height toggle you can adjust.
